# APB Protocol Design & Verification

This project implements the **Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)** protocol using Verilog/SystemVerilog and verifies it using a UVM-based testbench. The APB is part of the AMBA family of protocols developed by ARM and is designed for low-bandwidth, low-power peripheral interfaces.

## Overview

The project covers:

- RTL design of APB master and slave modules
- A Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) environment
- Functional coverage and assertion-based verification
- Various test scenarios including read, write, burst, and error handling
